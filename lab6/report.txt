//Problems encountered:
//-We didnt have a terrible time coding this lab. It was practically a copy and paste from the last lab and then just renaming
//--an array and changing acouple things. 

//-The main problem we had was that our tick function was getting called at during the inital set up and making some messages
//--get missed at the very begining even at 10000 tick rate.

//Hours spent on lab:
//Total Time spent == 6 hours
