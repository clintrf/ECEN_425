//Problems encountered:
//-I got hung up on having to initialize the variable at the top of the function and not in the middle.
//--There is documentation on this issue but I glazed over that particular part.

//-It also took me a good deal of time to figure out how to save and restore context. I understood pop and 
//--push but I didnâ€™t understand how to save and restore context without giving the dispatcher both a  
//--pointer to the ss and the sp? The creation of the example struct only had the sp (stackPointer) which
//--lead me to believe I needed to have implemented it with only the sp.

//-Didn't understand some of the documentation applied to what we were specificly codeing. 
//--It wasn't till after I figured it out that I realized how the documentation actually 
//--worked and by then it was to late.

//Hours spent on lab:
//-To get it to the point where it could compile for the first time took around 10 hours (not including my partners time) 
//-Debugging after that took another 5 to 6 hours. 

//=Total Time spent 16+ hours
