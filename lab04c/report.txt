//Problems encountered:
//-We felt like we understood the basics of what was suposto be going on but then we got hung up on actually understanding what
//--actually was happening with the nested interrupts. The way we implemented our dispature was ok, but ment we had to check
//--for nested interrupts in our myisr.s file. We spent hours bangging our heads against the wall trying to change things in
//--in the dispature when we really should have been looking in the isr. 

//--With regard to the previous comment, we were saving the SP of the delayed stack when the isr depth wasn't zero during 
//--a delay so that we wouldn't lose track of it. Once the depth returned to zero then we needed to stop saving that SP so 
//--we weren't over writing that variable because while the isr depth remain zero that stack pointer shouldn't be 
//--changing during key interrupts.

//--We should have just rewriten our dispature from scratch and simplified it. 

//Hours spent on lab:
//Total Time spent == 20+ hours
