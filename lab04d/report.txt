//Problems encountered:
// During this lab I dont think I added one line of code... I spend the entire 
// -- time debugging why it wouldn't run. The fix ended up being deleting a bunch
// -- of #defines at the beginning of our code and then adding a couple print 
// -- statments

//Hours spent on lab:
//Total Time spent == 5
